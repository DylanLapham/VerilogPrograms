# VerilogPrograms
This repository catalogs my programming journey with the Hardware Description Langauge (HDL) Verilog. All work was done with the Nexys A7 FPGA Trainer Board and the Vivado Design Suite

**Guide**
Initial program - Simply a blinking light on LED 0. Blinky is generally the starter program in hardware stuff. Comparable to "Hello, World!" in a general language like C.
Problem Set 1: 
  Subtractor - A 1-bit full subtractor described using logic functions derived from a truth table for a full subtractor. A second module is included which instantiates 4 of the single-bit subtractors and creates a 4-bit subtractor.   
  Associated TCL commands are given for testing cases.

  ALU - An 8-function arithmetic Logic Unit is described using case statements, assigning the proper output, and carrying out where necessary.

  Subtractor on a physical FPGA - An XDC constraints file is given corresponding to assignments to switches and LEDs. The code is the same as the subtractor.v file.

  Problem Set 2:
